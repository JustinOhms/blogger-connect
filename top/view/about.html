            I am using google blogger for quite long time [ almost two and half years ]. It's awesome service that we are getting for free.
            But it's editor is quite problmatic, it adds <code> &lt;div&gt; and &lt;br&gt;  </code> unexpectldy. So its hard to manage view of 
            post. 
        </p>
        </p>
            I tried to find online service or products which are giving easy editor like write.as. But don't find any. So, I decided to build one 
            for me.

        <h5 style="text-align: center">Ingredients</h5>
        <p> 
            Blogger editor is built on top of Blogger API v3, Golang And VueJS. VueJS-wyswyg editor and VueBlock used for UI and editor.
